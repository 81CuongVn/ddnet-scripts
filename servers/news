|Quick Tournament #54 on Knux by Knuski|
I'm happy to present you this year's first Tournament, the Race (★★★✰✰) map
"Knux" by Knuski.

The Tournament will be played on Sunday, January 24 at 20:00 CET on special
Tournament servers in every DDNet location. No one has seen the map yet and the
best time after 90 minutes will win! Since it's a Race map the map is played
alone.

Thanks to louis & ReD for testing the map!
